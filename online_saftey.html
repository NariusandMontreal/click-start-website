    <h2>Online Safety Basics</h2>

    <h3>Recognizing Scam Emails or Fake Websites</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Be wary of emails asking for personal information (passwords, bank details).</li>
        <li>Check the sender's email address carefully for unusual spellings or domains.</li>
        <li>Don't click on links in suspicious emails. Hover your mouse over the link to see where it really goes.</li>
        <li>Fake websites often have URLs that are slightly different from the real ones.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why Not to Share Passwords</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Your passwords are like your digital keys â€“ keep them private.</li>
        <li>Sharing passwords puts your accounts and personal information at risk.</li>
        <li>Even trusted friends or family might accidentally compromise your account.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Creating Strong Passwords</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Use a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.</li>
        <li>Make your passwords at least 12 characters long.</li>
        <li>Avoid using personal information like your name, birthday, or pet's name.</li>
        <li>Don't use the same password for multiple accounts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Understanding Antivirus Software (Basics)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Antivirus software helps protect your computer from harmful programs (malware).</li>
        <li>Keep your antivirus software up to date.</li>
        <li>Run regular scans of your computer.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Importance of Logging Out on Public Computers</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>When using a public computer (e.g., at a library or school), always log out of your accounts.</li>
        <li>This prevents others from accessing your personal information after you're done.</li>
        <li>Close the browser window after logging out for extra security.</li>
    </ul>
